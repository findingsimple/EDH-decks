## Notes
**Strategy:** This deck combines Elf tribal synergies with -1/-1 counter/proliferate themes. Morcant triggers blight on every Elf ETB, so the goal is to flood the board with Elves (via token generators like Lathril, Wolverine Riders, Elvish Promenade, Lys Alana Huntmaster) and then proliferate those counters to kill enemy creatures.

**Key Synergies:**
- Morcant + mass Elf token generation = mass blight triggers
- Proliferate effects (Contagion Engine, Vraska, Grim Affliction) grow -1/-1 counters
- Crumbling Ashes destroys creatures with -1/-1 counters each upkeep
- Chronicle of Victory gives all Elves +2/+2, first strike, and trample
- Skullclamp on 1/1 Elf tokens = massive card draw

**Win Conditions:**
- Overwhelm with pumped Elves (Coat of Arms, Ezuri, Chronicle of Victory)
- Shaman of the Pack / Exsanguinate for direct life loss
- Lathril's activated ability (tap 10 Elves to drain 10 life)
- Lock down enemy boards with proliferated -1/-1 counters

**Upgrade Ideas:**
- Collected Company (more creature tutoring)
- Overwhelming Stampede (backup finisher)
- Growing Rites of Itlimoc (ramp)
