## Notes
Strategy: Hold up mana, cast instants and flash creatures on opponents' turns to generate Faerie tokens. Goad opponents' creatures to keep them fighting each other while you build an evasive flying army.

Key combos:
- Alela + any instant = free Faerie token
- Obyra + Faerie tokens = drain all opponents
- Slitherwisp + flash spells = draw + drain
- Mistbind Clique = tap out an opponent during upkeep
- Kindred Discovery + Faeries = massive card draw (careful of decking yourself)
- Archmage of Echoes + Faerie spells = double your board
- Faerie Mastermind + wheel effects or Rhystic Study = massive draw
- Bitterblossom = free Faerie token every upkeep for Obyra triggers

Upgrade ideas:
- Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive (makes 1/1 tokens unblockable)
- Cover of Darkness (fear for all Faeries)
- Opposition (tap down opponents with tokens)
- Throat Cutter (faerie rogue, makes opponent discard)
